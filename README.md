# 🍽️ ML-Powered Restaurant Recommendation System



## 📋 Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Food delivery users face significant friction in the ordering process due to overwhelming restaurant choices and lack of contextual prioritization. This increases:

- **⏱️ Decision Fatigue**: Users spend 8-12 minutes browsing 200+ restaurant options and get overwhelmed
- **🛒 Cart Abandonment**: ~30% of users add items but don't complete checkout
- **🔄 Low Discovery**: 65% of orders are repeat orders from the same 3-5 restaurants
- **💸 Revenue Loss**: High-quality restaurants with availability go undiscovered

**Root Cause:** Current "Sort by: Distance/Rating/Delivery Time" approach is too generic and doesn't consider:
- User's historical preferences (cuisine, price, dietary needs)
- Contextual factors (time of day, weather, occasion)
- Real-time constraints (restaurant availability, delivery capacity)

---

### ✨ Solution Overview

An **ML-powered hybrid recommendation system** specifically for the **home feed** that combines:

### 1. Collaborative Filtering (40% weight)
- Learns from similar users' preferences
- "Users like you ordered from these restaurants"
- Enables discovery of unexpected matches

### 2. Content-Based Filtering (35% weight)
- Matches restaurant attributes to user profile
- Considers cuisine, price, rating, dietary restrictions
- Works even for new users (cold start handling)

### 3. Contextual Factors (25% weight)
- **Time of Day**: Breakfast → South Indian/Cafe, Dinner → Biryani/Chinese
- **Weather**: Rainy → Comfort food, Hot → Beverages/Desserts
- **Distance**: Exponential decay penalty for far restaurants
- **Popularity**: Slight boost for trending restaurants

**Hybrid Score Calculation:**
```python
Final Score = 0.40 × CF_Score + 0.35 × CB_Score + 0.25 × Context_Score
```

### Algorithms Used

**Collaborative Filtering:**
- User-based CF with cosine similarity
- Top-30 similar users for recommendation
- Handles sparsity with sparse matrix representation

**Content-Based Filtering:**
- Weighted feature matching (cuisine 40%, price 25%, rating 20%, delivery 15%)
- StandardScaler normalization
- Dietary restriction hard filters

**Contextual Scoring:**
- Time-based cuisine boosting (1.3-1.5× multiplier)
- Weather-based adjustments
- Distance decay (exponential: e^(-dist/3km))

**Hybrid Combination:**
```python
if user_order_count >= 3:
    final_score = 0.40*cf + 0.35*cb + 0.25*context
else:  # Cold start
    final_score = 0.75*cb + 0.25*context
```

## 📊 Evaluation Results

Evaluated on 100 test users with temporal train-test split:

### Accuracy Metrics

| Metric | @5 | @10 | @20 | Interpretation |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|----------------|
| **Precision** | 0.0842 | 0.0756 | 0.0621 | 7.6% of top-10 were ordered |
| **Recall** | 0.1234 | 0.2145 | 0.3521 | 21.5% of actual orders in top-10 |
| **Hit Rate** | 0.3156 | 0.4823 | 0.6421 | **48.2% users ordered from top-10** |
| **NDCG** | 0.2134 | 0.2567 | - | Good ranking quality |

### Discovery Metrics

| Metric | Score | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Diversity** | 0.7234 | 7+ cuisines in top-10 recommendations |
| **Novelty** | 0.6421 | 64% are new restaurants for user |
| **Coverage** | 0.4523 | 45% of catalog recommended across all users |

### Baseline Comparison

| Approach | Hit Rate@10 | Diversity | Trade-off Decision |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Random | 0.05 | 0.85 | ❌ Too low accuracy |
| Popular Only | 0.32 | 0.23 | ❌ No personalization |
| Pure CF | 0.51 | 0.58 | ⚠️ Better accuracy but lower diversity |
| **Hybrid (Ours)** | **0.48** | **0.72** | ✅ **Best balance** |

**Decision Rationale:** Traded 3% hit rate for 24% more diversity to prevent recommendation fatigue.

## 💡 Product Thinking

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Time-to-Order over CTR
❌ **Could have optimized for:** Click-through rate (common ML metric)  
✅ **Chose instead:** Time-to-order  

**Why:** CTR is a vanity metric. It doesn't address the user's real pain: decision fatigue. Time-to-order directly measures whether we're solving the problem.

**PM Perspective:**
> "I could have optimized for CTR—that's what most ML projects do. But CTR doesn't address the user's pain point. A user clicking through 50 restaurants still takes 10 minutes to order. Time-to-order measures what actually matters: are we reducing decision fatigue?"

#### 2. Explainability over Pure Accuracy
❌ **Could have used:** Deep learning (2-3% better accuracy)  
✅ **Chose instead:** Simple models with clear explanations  

**Why:** Food recommendations require trust. Users won't order from a restaurant they don't understand why it was suggested. Explainability isn't optional—it's core to adoption.

**PM Perspective:**
> "I deliberately chose simpler models over deep learning. Why? Because food needs trust. Users won't order from a 'black box' recommendation. Every suggestion has a clear reason: 'You've ordered South Indian 3 times, rated 4.5/5 by 856 customers.' That's worth more than 2% accuracy."

#### 3. Diversity Constraints over Pure Precision
❌ **Could have shown:** Top-10 all from user's favorite cuisine  
✅ **Chose instead:** Max 3 restaurants per cuisine  

**Why:** Pure precision creates a filter bubble. Long-term user satisfaction requires variety. Prevent recommendation fatigue.

**PM Perspective:**
> "I enforce a max of 3 restaurants per cuisine in the top-10. This costs some precision but prevents the filter bubble. If I only showed North Indian because that's what you ordered before, you'd get bored fast. Discovery matters for retention."

### Success Metrics Framework

**Primary Metric (North Star):**
- **Time to Order**: 40% reduction (10 min → 6 min)
- **Why Primary:** Directly addresses user pain point

**Secondary Metrics:**
- Order conversion rate: +15%
- Restaurant discovery: 2+ new restaurants/month
- **Why Secondary:** Important but not the core problem

**Guardrail Metrics:**
- Average delivery time: ≤38 minutes
- Order cancellation rate: ≤6%
- User dissatisfaction: ≤10%
- **Why Guardrails:** Prevent quality degradation while optimizing primary metric

**Stakeholder Balance:**
- **Users**: Want relevance + variety (conflicting!)
- **Restaurants**: Want visibility (but fair distribution)
- **Platform**: Wants revenue (but not at cost of trust)

**Trade-offs Made:**
1. **Explainability > Accuracy**: Users need reasons before ordering food
2. **Diversity > Precision**: Prevent recommendation fatigue
3. **Speed > Perfection**: 6-minute decision time is "good enough"
